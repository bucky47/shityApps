   <h1 class="headline heading-content">What Is Chayote Squash, Exactly</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sure, you know about pumpkins (and their lattes) and have likely heard about butternut and acorn squash, too. But what about chayote squash? Similar to a pear in size and shape, this bright green gourd is a type of summer squash that boasts a long, vibrant history *and* is stocked with essential nutrients such as fiber, magnesium, and calcium. Here are chayote's benefits, along with how to buy, cook, and eat chayote.</p>

<h2>What Is Chayote?</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Chayote (aka vegetable pear or mirliton) is a type of summer squash, says Wesley McWhorter, M.S., R.D., chef and dietitian at&nbsp;<a class="external-link" title="(opens new window)" href="https://sph.uth.edu/research/centers/dell/faculty-member.htm?member=010e127d-8430-47c3-8ca7-883875cbee59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UTHealth School of Public Health</a>. It's technically considered a fruit &mdash; much like a tomato &mdash; but it probably isn't something you want to bite into like an apple. Mild in taste and crunchy in texture, this lumpy green gourd grows on a long climbing vine in warm climates across the globe. While it only made its way to the U.S. in the late nineteenth century, chayote&rsquo;s been cultivated since pre-Columbian times, according to the&nbsp;<a class="external-link" title="(opens new window)" href="https://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/1492/chayote.html" target="_blank">Center for New Crops and Plant Products at Purdue University</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact,&nbsp;<a class="external-link" title="(opens new window)" href="https://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/1492/chayote.html" target="_blank">findings suggest</a>&nbsp;that a variety of chayote squash &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Sechium edule&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;</em>&mdash; was widely distributed in &ldquo;Mesoamerica&rdquo; (the geographical and cultural area extending from Mexico down through Central America, including Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador). From there, it&rsquo;s believed that the pear-shaped squash spread south towards (and throughout) South America, further solidifying itself as an integral part of cuisines and even medical treatments, according to the&nbsp;<a class="external-link" title="(opens new window)" href="https://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/1492/chayote.html" target="_blank">Center for New Crops and Plant Products at Purdue University</a>. While chayote leaves aren&rsquo;t still used today to dissolve kidney stones, the fruit as a whole is still loaded with potential benefits. And on that note&hellip;</p>
<h2>Chayote's Benefits and Nutrition</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar to other fruits, chayote is high in antioxidants and vitamins &mdash; specifically vitamin B, vitamin C, potassium, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.shape.com/healthy-eating/diet-tips/ask-diet-doctor-essential-amino-acids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amino acids</a>. It has a super impressive nutrition profile, too: One chayote (~203 grams) has just 39 calories, .3 grams of fat, and 9 grams carbohydrates, according to the&nbsp;<a class="external-link" title="(opens new window)" href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170402/nutrients" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>&nbsp;(USDA). While it's not necessarily the most protein-packed produce on the market (1.7 grams in one chayote), the summer squash is packed with other positive nutrients, such as filling fiber, mood-boosting magnesium, and bone-strengthening calcium.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>That said, a vast amount of the nutrients are in the peel, so be sure to keep it on while cooking and eating. Overall, chayote works well as a replacement for starchy vegetables for anyone looking to cut carbs or who is following a low-carb diet such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.shape.com/healthy-eating/diet-tips/whats-the-keto-diet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keto</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.shape.com/healthy-eating/diet-tips/atkins-diet-brings-back-some-carbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atkins</a>.</p>

<h2>How to Buy Chayote</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Chayote is available in grocery stores. However, if your produce section leaves something to be desired, you may have better luck finding it at more of a specialty store such as Whole Foods or at your local farmers' market. Because warm climates offer a longer growing season for chayote squash, it's more likely that the fruit will be available year-long in areas with warmer weather.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To choose a ripe chayote, look for one that's firm to the touch, between light and dark green in color, and without any brown soft spots (varying colors are fine as long as the fruit is firm).</p>
