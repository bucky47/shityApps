    <p>Lyon became a major economic hub during the Renaissance. The city is recognised for&nbsp;<strong>its cuisine and gastronomy</strong>, as well as historical and architectural landmarks; as such, the districts of Old Lyon, the Fourvi&egrave;re hill, the Presqu'&icirc;le and the slopes of the Croix-Rousse are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.</p>
  <p>Despite being France's third-largest city, the country's gastronomical capital, and home to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Lyon tends to fly under the tourist radar. These 12 impressive&nbsp;<strong>sights, historic landmarks, and fun traditions of</strong>&nbsp;the city make it well worth a visit.</p>
  <p>Located in south-eastern France, Lyon is&nbsp;<strong>a geographic hub for agricultural produce</strong>. Its cuisine combines ingredients from the north &ndash; such as chicken from Bresse, Charolais beef, and ample cream and butter &ndash; with the fresh, seasonal vegetables, wine, and olive oil produced in the valleys further south.</p>
  <p><strong>Lyon has been ranked as the most attractive city in France</strong>, toppling the likes of beautiful Bordeaux and picturesque Paris. Find out what it has over the other French cities. If you want a good quality of life, then Bordeaux's your best bet</p>
  <p>Lyon is&nbsp;<strong>a highly walkable city</strong>, which is a great thing because it's also one of the great food cities of the world.</p>
  <p><strong>Bordeaux is more open spaced than Lyon</strong>, with the river and the docks. Lyon feels more dense. However Lyon has better restaurants (or at least a greater number of good restaurants), and has kept more of its medieval stone buildings than Bordeaux (which has some, just less).</p>
  <p>No visit to Lyon would be complete without eating in a bouchon, where you will discover part of the city's heritage. ... In a nutshell, it is&nbsp;<strong>a restaurant where people enjoy Lyon specialities, washed down with a pitcher of regional wine</strong>, in a warm and welcoming atmosphere.</p>
